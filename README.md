# Amazon IP Ranges

Amazon provides a list of the IP addresses they use in a public file called ip-ranges.json, which is available directly on their website https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json.

I needed to convert this file into a RAW file for a specific use, which is why I created this Python program that takes this file and converts it to give me what I want.

This file will be updated regularly, but if you want to receive updates yourself, feel free to clone this project.
